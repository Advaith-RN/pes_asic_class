- sky130 is the 130nm library
- tt => typical libraries ; Can range from slow, to fast, to typical.
- 025C is Operating temp
- 1v8 is voltage
- PVT => Process, Voltage, Temperature
- PVT defines the 3 parameters that determine the conditions a circuit must operate under
- CMOS Technology is used
- The cell keyword is used frequently
- Logic gates are defined.

## Herarchial vs Flat Synthesis
Lets also analyse the multiple_modules.v file
